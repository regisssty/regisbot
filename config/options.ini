; Restrict the bot to only listen to certain text channels.  Uncomment (remove the ; at the start of the line) and add channel IDs to enable.
; An id looks like this number: 41771983423143930
; To get a channel id, escape (put a \ in front of) a channel mention in chat and copy the number that comes up on chat, like this: \#your-music-channel
; or right click the channel in discord and click "Copy Link".  The second number is the channel id.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
